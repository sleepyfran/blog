Oh, hello there! Thanks for taking a look at my little knowledge garden. Here I'm planning to create little nuggets of stuff that I'm finding while I'm learning a certain technology/language/whatever I happen to be learning at that time. I initially intended this to be a private Obsidian vault, but figured there was no harm in publishing all this in case somebody else finds some use to it, so here it is in all its raw glory ðŸ˜€

If you find any mistake don't hesitate to reach out through an issue in [the page's repo](https://github.com/sleepyfran/knowledge).
